# Steps to rig the prankster (Windows)
- Open the `script.bat` and edit the `location\to\prank.ps1` with the absolute path to the `prank.ps1` in your system.

- Navigate to the __Startup__ folder(give `shell:startup` to the __Windows Run__ to open the same).

- Move the `script.bat` to the __Startup__ folder.

- And on your next boot, a surprise will be waiting for you!
